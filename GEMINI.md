# Project Overview

This directory contains the documentation for the "Dotfiles Installer" project. The documentation is built using VitePress, a Vue-powered static site generator. `bun` is used as the package manager for this project.

The primary goal of this repository is to provide comprehensive guides and information related to the Dotfiles Installer.

# Key Files

*   **`README.md`**: Provides a brief introduction to the documentation and how to get started.
*   **`package.json`**: Defines project metadata, dependencies (including `vitepress` and `bun`), and scripts for managing the documentation.
*   **`bun.lock`**: The lock file generated by `bun` to ensure consistent dependency installations.
*   **`docs/`**: This directory contains all the markdown source files for the documentation, organized into various sections (e.g., `getting-started`, `install`, `dev`).
*   **`docs/.vitepress/config.ts`**: The main configuration file for VitePress, controlling the site's structure, theme, and build process.
